# Simple Chat Room Client

This is a simple chat room client written in Python. The client connects to a chat room server and displays the welcome message received from the server. It then receives a unique username from the server and prints it. The client creates a separate thread for receiving messages so that it can display received messages concurrently with sending messages. Users can enter their messages through standard input and send them to the server.
